# Master list of MSL's variables standard_names and descriptions (CF convention)
# Based on: http://cfconventions.org/standard-names.html

# IMPORTANT:
# (1) Do not use double-quotes within strings (they are already used in nc_attrs.py to call ncatted)
# (2) Do not assign key values as empty strings (at least a space must be used)
# (3) Each standard_name key should have a variable_name list which contains all names that
#     variables associated with that standard_name in the netcdf files may have. Each netcdf
#     variable name (e.g., hs, ugrd10m) should appear in only one list (there can not be more than
#     one standard_name for a given variable).

            Sea surface temperature is usually abbreviated as 'SST'. It is the
            temperature of sea water near the surface (including the part under
            sea-ice, if any), and not the skin temperature, whose standard name is
            surface_temperature. For the temperature of sea water at a particular
            depth or layer, a data variable of sea_water_temperature with a vertical
            coordinate axis should be used.

        variable_name:   ['temp', 'water_temp']
        long_name:       sea water temperature
        canonical_units: 'K'
        description:     >
            Sea water temperature is the in situ temperature of the sea water. To
            specify the depth at which the temperature applies use a vertical
            coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable. There are standard
            names for sea_surface_temperature, sea_surface_skin_temperature,
            sea_surface_subskin_temperature and sea_surface_foundation_temperature
            which can be used to describe data located at the specified surfaces.
            For observed data, depending on the period during which the observation
            was made, the measured in situ temperature was recorded against standard
            'scales'. These historical scales include the International Practical
            Temperature Scale of 1948 (IPTS-48; 1948-1967), the International
            Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68, Barber, 1969; 1968-1989)
            and the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90, Saunders 1990;
            1990 onwards). Conversion of data between these scales follows
            t68 = t48 - (4.4 x 10e-6) * t48(100 - t - 48); t90 = 0.99976 * t68.
            Observations made prior to 1948 (IPTS-48) have not been documented and
            therefore a conversion cannot be certain. Differences between t90 and
            t68 can be up to 0.01 at temperatures of 40 C and above; differences of
            0.002-0.007 occur across the standard range of ocean temperatures
            (-10 - 30 C). The International Equation of State of Seawater 1980
            (EOS-80, UNESCO, 1981) and the Practical Salinity Scale (PSS-78) were
            both based on IPTS-68, while the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010
            (TEOS-10) is based on ITS-90. References: Barber, 1969,

            Absolute Salinity, S_A, is defined as part of the Thermodynamic Equation
            of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) which was adopted in 2010 by the
            Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). It is the mass fraction
            of dissolved material in sea water. Absolute Salinity incorporates the
            spatial variations in the composition of sea water. This type of Absolute
            Salinity is also called 'Density Salinity'. TEOS-10 estimates Absolute
            Salinity as the salinity variable that, when used with the TEOS-10
            expression for density, yields the correct density of a sea water sample
            even when the sample is not of Reference Composition. In practice,
            Absolute Salinity is often calculated from Practical Salinity using a
            spatial lookup table of pre-defined values of the Absolute Salinity Anomaly.
            It is recommended that the version of (TEOS-10) software and the associated
            Absolute Salinity Anomaly climatology be specified within metadata by
            attaching a comment attribute to the data variable. Reference:

            There are also standard names for the precisely defined salinity quantities
            sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity observations between
            1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used for salinity observations

            observations from 1978 onwards), sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and
            sea_water_reference_salinity. Salinity quantities that do not match any
            of the precise definitions should be given the more general standard name
            of sea_water_salinity.

            If a sea water sample has the Reference Composition (defined in

            (35.16504 g kg-1)/35 times Practical Salinity. Reference: www.teos-10.org;
            Millero et al., 2008 doi: 10.1016/j.dsr.2007.10.001. There are also standard
            names for the precisely defined salinity quantities sea_water_knudsen_salinity,

            should be given the more general standard name of sea_water_salinity.

    sea_surface_salinity:
        variable_name:   ['sss']
        canonical_units: '1e-3'
        description:     >
            Sea surface salinity is the salt content of sea water close to the sea
            surface, often on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978. However, the
            unqualified term 'salinity' is generic and does not necessarily imply
            any particular method of calculation. The units of salinity are
            dimensionless and the units attribute should normally be given as 1e-3
            or 0.001 i.e. parts per thousand. Sea surface salinity is often
            abbreviated as 'SSS'. For the salinity of sea water at a particular depth
            or layer, a data variable of 'sea_water_salinity' or one of the more
            precisely defined salinities should be used with a vertical coordinate
            axis. There are standard names for the precisely defined salinity
            quantities: sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity
            observations between 1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used for
            salinity observations between 1967 and 1977), sea_water_practical_salinity,
            S_P (used for salinity observations from 1978 to the present day),
            sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and
            sea_water_reference_salinity. Practical Salinity is reported on the
            Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (PSS-78), and is usually based on the
            electrical conductivity of sea water in observations since the 1960s.
            Conversion of data between the observed scales follows:
            S_P = (S_K - 0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805) and S_P = S_C, however the
            accuracy of the latter is dependent on whether chlorinity or conductivity
            was used to determine the S_C value, with this inconsistency driving the
            development of PSS-78. The more precise standard names should be used
            where appropriate for both modelled and observed salinities. In particular,
            the use of sea_water_salinity to describe salinity observations made
            from 1978 onwards is now deprecated in favor of the term
            sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity quantity stored by
            national data centers for post-1978 observations. The only exception to
            this is where the observed salinities are definitely known not to be
            recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. The unit 'parts per thousand'
            was used for sea_water_knudsen_salinity and sea_water_cox_salinity.

            The wave directional spectrum can be written as a five dimensional function
            S(t,x,y,f,theta) where t is time, x and y are horizontal coordinates
            (such as longitude and latitude), f is frequency and theta is direction.
            S has the standard name sea_surface_wave_directional_variance_spectral_density.
            S can be integrated over direction to give S1= integral(S dtheta) and this
            quantity has the standard name sea_surface_wave_variance_spectral_density.
            Frequency moments, M(n) of S1 can then be calculated as follows:
            M(n) = integral(S1 f^n df), where f^n is f to the power of n. The second
            wave period, T(m2) is calculated as the square root of the ratio M(0)/M(2).
